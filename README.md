## 🎯 The Problem It Solves

In today’s world, learners are overwhelmed by the sheer number of available resources — courses, tutorials, and tools.  
Most struggle to find **personalized learning paths**, lack a **structured roadmap**, and miss out on **community-driven growth** opportunities.  
Traditional platforms focus on content delivery, not learner experience or personalization.

---

**Skill-Metric** bridges this gap by offering a **personalized AI-driven recommendation platform** that adapts to each learner’s interests, goals, and progress.  
From generating **custom skill roadmaps** to **recommending curated resources**, and from **social-style feeds** to **community learning groups**, Skill-Metric brings together everything a learner needs to grow — intelligently and collaboratively.

Our mission is to create a dynamic ecosystem that **measures, visualizes, and enhances learning progress**, helping individuals and teams achieve their goals faster.
