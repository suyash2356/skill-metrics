## 🎯 The Problem It Solves

In today’s world, learners are overwhelmed by the sheer number of available resources — courses, tutorials, and tools.  
Most struggle to find **personalized learning paths**, lack a **structured roadmap**, and miss out on **community-driven growth** opportunities.  
Traditional platforms focus on content delivery, not learner experience or personalization.

## 🤖 Built with AI Assistance

Skill-Metric was developed with the help of modern **AI-assisted tools and frameworks**.  
While AI contributed to parts of the implementation, every feature — from the **concept, design, and technology decisions** to the **user experience and functionality** — was **carefully planned, directed, and refined manually**.  

This project demonstrates how **AI can enhance human creativity**, empowering builders to transform ideas into reality through learning, experimentation, and innovation.

---

## 💡 Vision

Skill-Metric was conceptualized, designed, and implemented with a strong focus on innovation and user-centric learning experiences.  
It’s more than just a recommendation platform — it’s your **AI learning companion**, designed to help you **grow smarter, faster, and together**.

## 🎓 About the Project & Future Goals

This project was developed as part of a **college initiative**, understanding foundation of development in **Web App** and **Machine Learning**.  
Currently, the recommendation system utilizes **Hugging Face models** for intelligent resource suggestions.  

My long-term goal is to become a **dedicated AI/ML Engineer** — and as I continue learning machine learning, I plan to build and integrate **custom ML models** specifically optimized for Skill-Metric’s recommendation engine.  
Future versions of this platform will be **fully developed and trained by me**, combining hands-on engineering with the creative power of AI.

Your feedback will be highly usefull for me.
